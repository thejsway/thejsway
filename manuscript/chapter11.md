# Project: a social news program

Now that you've discovered the basics of programming, let's go ahead and build a real project.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to build a basic social news program. Its user will be able to show a list of links and add new ones.

## Functional requirements

* A link is defined by its title, its URL and its author (submitter).
* If a new link URL does not start with `"http://"` or `"https://"`, `"http://"` is automatically added at its beginning.
* At launch, the program displays a start menu with the possible actions in an alert window and asks the user for his choice. Possible actions are:
  * Show the list of links.
  * Add a new link.
  * Remove an existing link.
  * Quit the program.
* Showing the list of links displays the index (rank) and the properties of each link in an alert window, or a message in the absence of any link.
* When adding a link, the program asks the user for the new link properties (title, URL and author). The link is then created. Subsequently, it must appear in the showed links.
* When removing a link, the user is asked for the link index until it is correct. The associated link is then removed. Subsequently, it must disappear from the showed links. Removing a link is not possible if there are no existing links.
* After an action is performed, the start menu is shown again. This goes on until the user chooses to quit the program.

## Technical requirements

* All your code should be correctly indented.
* Names should be wisely chosen and adhere to the camelCase convention.
* Code duplication should be avoided.

## Expected result

Here are a few screenshots of the expected result.
