# Acknowledgments

This book was built upon two online courses I wrote for the French EdTech startup [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com):

* [Learn to code with JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/learn-the-basics-of-javascript) ([Apprenez à coder avec JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-coder-avec-javascript))
* [Use JavaScript in your web projects](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/use-javascript-on-the-web) ([Créez des pages web interactives avec JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/creez-des-pages-web-interactives-avec-javascript))

Thanks to [Jessica Mautref](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicamautref) for her watchful eye during the writing process, and to [Emily Reese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eclairereese) for the initial English translation. Both also contributed many good ideas.

I've been inspired by other authors who decided to publish their books in an open way: [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify), [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://www.nczonline.net/), [Axel Rauschmayer](http://dr-axel.de/) and [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/).

Thanks to everyone who improved the book content through contributions: Gilad Penn, NewMountain, Emre Akbudak, opheron. Special thanks to Theo Armour.
