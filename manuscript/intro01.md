# About this book

First thing first: thanks for having chosen this book. I hope reading it will be both beneficial and pleasurable to you.

## Who this book is for

This book is primarily designed for beginners. Having taught programming basics to hundreds of students, I tried to write it in the most friendly and accessible way possible. My goal was that no matter their background, everyone interested in programming should be able to follow along without too much difficulty.

However, this book can also be useful to people having some experience in software development. The JavaScript language is kind of a strange beast. It shares some similarities with other well-known programming languages such as Java or C#, starting with its syntax. On the other hand, JavaScript has *a lot* of unique characteristics that are worth learning. This book covers the majority of them. As such, it will be of interest to those wanting to get serious with JavaScript or needing their skills refreshed with the latest language evolutions.

## Overview

This book is divided into three main parts. The first one teaches the basics of programming with JavaScript. The second one explains how to use JavaScript to create interactive web pages. The third one deals with more advanced concepts of the language. Each part depends on the previous ones, but there's no other prerequisite to reading.

Each chapter starts with a **TL;DR** paragraph which summarizes it, so you'll be able to skip ahead if you already know a chapter's content.

At the end of each chapter, a series of short and focused exercises will make you put your newly acquired skills into practice. Searching them seriously is *essential*: real learning comes with practicing, not just reading.

Complete beginner or already experienced in programming, I wish you a great journey in the wonderful world of JavaScript!
