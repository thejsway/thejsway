# Play with variables

You know how to use JavaScript to display values. However, for a program to be truly useful, it must be able to store data, like information entered by a user. Let's check that out.

## TL;DR

* A **variable** is an information storage area. Every variable has a **name**, a **value** and a **type**. In JavaScript, the type of a variable is deduced from the value stored in it: JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language.

* A variable is declared using the `let` keyword followed by the variable name. To declare a **constant** (a variable whose initial value will never change), it's better to use the `const` keyword instead.

* To give a value to a variable, we use the **assignment operator** `=`. For number variables, the operators `+=` and `++` can **increment** (increase by 1) their value.

* The **scope** of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is visible. Variables declared with `let` or `const` are **block-scoped**. A **code block** is a portion of a program delimited by a pair of opening and closing curly braces `{ ... }`.

* An **expression** is a piece of code that combines variables, values and operators. Evaluating an expression produces a value, which has a type.

* Expressions may be included in strings delimited by a pair of backticks (\`). Such a string is called a **template literal**.

* **Type conversions** may happen implicitly during the evaluation of an expression, or explicitly when using the `Number()` and `String()` commands, to obtain a respectively a number or a string.

* The `prompt()` and `alert()` commands deal with information input and display under the form of dialog boxes.

* Variable naming is essential to program visibility. Following a naming convention like [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) is good practice.

## Variables

### Role of a variable

A computer program stores data using variables. A **variable** is an information storage area. We can imagine it as a box in which you can put and store things!

### Variable properties

A variable has three main properties:

* Its **name**, which identifies it. A variable name may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers (not in the first position) and characters like the dollar (`$`) or underscore (`_`).
* Its **value**, which is the data stored in the variable.
* Its **type**, which determines the role and actions available to the variable.

I> You don't have to define a variable type explicitly in JavaScript. Its type is deduced from the value stored in the variable and may change while the program runs. That's why we say that JavaScript is a **dynamically typed** language. Other languages, like C or Java, require variable types to always be defined. This is called **static typing**.

### Declaring a variable

Before you can store information in a variable, you have to create it! This is called declaring a variable. **Declaring** a variable means the computer reserves memory in which to store the variable. The program can then read or write data in this memory area by manipulating the variable.

Here's a code example that declares a variable and shows its contents:

```js
let a;
console.log(a);
```

In JavaScript, you declare a variable with the `let`  keyword followed by the variable name. In this example, the variable created is called `a`.

I> In previous versions of the language, variables were declared using the `var` keyword.

Here's the execution result for this program.

![Execution result](images/chapter02-01.png)

Note that the result is `undefined`. This is a special JavaScript type indicating no value. I declared the variable, calling it `a`, but didn't give it a value!

### Assign values to variables

While a program is running, the value stored in a variable can change. To give a new value to a variable, use the `=` operator called the **assignment operator**.

Check out the example below:

```js
let a;
a = 3.14;
console.log(a);
```

![Execution result](images/chapter02-02.png)

We modified the variable by assigning it a value. `a = 3.14` reads as "a receives the value 3.14".

E> Be careful not to confuse the assignment operator `=` with mathematical equality! You'll soon see how to express equality in JavaScript.

You can also combine declaring a variable and assigning it a value in one line. Just know that, within this line, you're doing two different things at once:

```js
let a = 3.14;
console.log(a);
```

### Declaring a constant variable

If the initial value of a variable won't ever change during the rest of program execution, this variable is called a **constant**. This constantness can be enforced by using the keyword `const` instead of `let` to declare it. Thus, the program is more expressive and further attempts to modify the variable can be detected as errors.

```js
const a = 3.14; // The value of a cannot be modified
a = 6.28;       // Impossible!
```

![Attempt to modify a constant variable](images/chapter02-03.png)

### Increment a number variable

You can also increase or decrease a value of a number with `+=`  and `++`. The latter is called an **increment operator**, as it allows incrementation (increase by 1) of a variable's value.

In the following example, lines 2 and 3 each increase the value of variable b  by 1.

```js
let b = 0;      // b contains 0
b += 1;         // b contains 1
b++;            // b contains 2
console.log(b); // Shows 2
```

### Variable scope

The **scope** of a variable is the part of the program where the variable is visible and usable. Variables declared with `let` or `const` are **block-scoped**: their visibility is limited to the block where they are declared (and every sub-block, if any). In JavaScript and many other programming languages, a **code block** is a portion of a program delimited by a pair of opening and closing braces. By default, a JavaScript program forms one block of code.

```js
let nb1 = 0;
{
  nb1 = 1; // OK : nb1 is declared in the parent block
  const nb2 = 0;
}
console.log(nb1); // OK : nb1 is declared in the current block
console.log(nb2); // Error! nb2 is not visible here
```

## Expressions

An **expression** is a piece of code that produces a value. An expression is created by combining variables, values and operators. Every expression has a value and thus a type. Calculating an expression's value is called **evaluation**. During evaluation, variables are replaced by their values.

```js
// 3 is an expression whose value is 3
const c = 3;
// c is an expression whose value is the value of c (3 here)
let d = c;
// (d + 1) is an expression whose value is d's + 1 (4 here)
d = d + 1; // d now contains the value 4
console.log(d); // Show 4
```

Operator priority inside an expression is the same as in math. However, an expression can integrate **parenthesis** that modify these priorities.

```js
let e = 3 + 2 * 4; // e contains 11 (3 + 8)
e = (3 + 2) * 4;   // e contains 20 (5 * 4)
```

It is possible to include expressions in a string by using **backticks** (\`) to delimit the string. Such a string is called a **template literal**. Inside a template literal, expressions are identified by the `${expression}` syntax.

This is often used to create strings containing the values of some variables.

```js
const country = "France";
console.log(`I live in ${country}`); // Show "I live in France"
const x = 3;
const y = 7;
console.log(`${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`); // Show "3 + 7 = 10"
```

## Type conversions

An expression's evaluation can result in type conversions. These are called **implicit** conversions, as they happen automatically without the programmer's intervention. For example, using the `+` operator between a string and a number causes the concatenation of the two values into a string result.

```js
const f = 100;
// Show "Variable f contains the value 100"
console.log("Variable f contains the value " + f);
```

JavaScript is extremely tolerant in terms of type conversion. However, sometimes conversion isn't possible. If a number fails to convert, you'll get the result `NaN` (*Not a Number*).

```js
const g = "five" * 2;
console.log(g); // Show NaN
```

Sometimes you'll wish to convert the value of another type. This is called **explicit** conversion. JavaScript has the `Number()`  and `String()` commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.

```js
const h = "5";
console.log(h + 1); // Concatenation: show the string "51"
const i = Number("5");
console.log(i + 1); // Numerical addition: show the number 6
```

## User interactions

### Entering information

Once you start using variables, you can write programs that exchange information with the user.

```js
const name = prompt("Enter your first name:");
alert(`Hello, ${name}`);
```

During execution, an dialog box pops up, asking for your name.

![Execution result](images/chapter02-04.png)

This is the result of the JavaScript command `prompt("Enter your first name:")`.

Type your name and click **OK**. You'll then get a personalized greeting.

![Execution result](images/chapter02-05.png)

The value you entered in the first dialog box has been stored as a string in the variable `name`. The JavaScript command `alert()`  then triggered the display of the second box, containing the result of the concatenation of the string `"Hello, "`  with the value of the `name` variable.

### Displaying information

Both `console.log()` (encountered in the previous chapter) and `alert()` can be used to display information to the user. Unlike `alert()`, `console.log()` does not stop program execution and is often a better choice.

`console.log()` can also display several comma-separated values at once.

```js
const temp1 = 36.9;
const temp2 = 37.6;
const temp3 = 37.1;
console.log(temp1, temp2, temp3); // Show "36.9 37.6 37.1"
```

### Entering a number

Regardless of the entered data, the `prompt()` command always returns a string value. If this value is to be used in numerical expressions, it *must* be converted into a number with the `Number()` command.

```js
const input = prompt("Enter a number:"); // input's type is string
const nb = Number(input); // nb's type is number
```

Both operations can be combined in one line for the same result.

```js
const nb = Number(prompt("Enter a number:")); // nb's type is number
```

In this example, the user input is directly converted in a number value by the `Number()` command and stored in the `nb` variable.

## Variable naming

To close this chapter, let's discuss variable naming. The computer doesn't care about variable names. You could name your variables using the classic example of a single letter (`a`, `b`, `c`...) or choose absurd names like `burrito`  or `puppieskittens90210`.

Nonetheless, naming variables well can make your code much easier to read. Check out these two examples:

```js
const a = 5.5;
const b = 3.14;
const c = 2 * a * b;
console.log(c);
```

```js
const radius = 5.5;
const pi = 3.14;
const perimeter = 2 * pi * radius;
console.log(perimeter);
```

They function in the same way, but the second version is much easier to understand.

Naming things is an important part of the programmer's job. Refer to the [appendix](#style-guide) for some useful advice.

## Coding time!

Build a habit of choosing good variables name in all exercises, starting with these ones.

### Improved hello

Write a program that asks the user for his first name and his last name. The program then displays them in one sentence.

### Final values

Observe the following program and try to predict the final values of its variables.

```js
let a = 2;
a -= 1;
a++;
let b = 8;
b += 2;
const c = a + b * b;
const d = a * b + b;
const e = a * (b + b);
const f = a * b / a;
const g = b / a * a;
console.log(a, b, c, d, e, f, g);
```

Check your prediction by executing it.

### VAT calculation

Write a program that asks the user for a raw price. After that, it calculates the corresponding final price using a VAT rate of 20.6%.

### From Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees

Write a program that asks for a temperature in Celsius degrees, then displays it in Fahrenheit degrees.

> The conversion between scales is given by the formula: [°F] = [°C] x 9/5 + 32.

### Variable swapping

Observe the following program.

```js
let number1 = 5;
let number2 = 3;

// TODO: type your code here (and nowhere else!)

console.log(number1); // Should show 3
console.log(number2); // Should show 5
```

Add the necessary code to swap the values of variables `number1` and `number2`.

T> This exercise has several valid solutions. You may use more than two variables to solve it.
