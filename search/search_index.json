The best practice for single or double quotes is a whole political thing. Use whichever you like, but don\u2019t mix the two in the same program!</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Always remember to close a string with the same type of quotation marks you started it with.</p> <p>To include special characters in a string, use the <code>\\</code> character (backslash) before the character. For example, type <code>\\n</code> to add a new line within a string: <code>\"This is\\na multiline string\"</code>.</p> <p>You cannot add or subtract string values like you'd do with numbers. However, the <code>+</code> operator has a special meaning when applied to two string values. It will join the two chains together, and this operation is called a concatenation.

This is called static typing.</p>"},{"location":"chapter02/#declaring-a-variable","title":"Declaring a variable","text":"<p>Before you can store information in a variable, you have to create it! This is called declaring a variable. Declaring a variable means the computer reserves memory in which to store the variable.

In this example, the variable created is called <code>a</code>.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Previously, JavaScript variables were declared using the <code>var</code> keyword.

You'll soon see how to express equality in JavaScript.</p> <p>You can also combine declaring a variable and assigning it a value in one line.

Variables declared with <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> are block-scoped: their visibility is limited to the block where they are declared (and every sub-block, if any). In JavaScript and many other programming languages, a code block is a portion of a program delimited by a pair of opening and closing braces. By default, a JavaScript program forms one block of code.</p> <pre><code>let num1 = 0;\n{\nnum1 = 1; // OK : num1 is declared in the parent block\nconst num2 = 0;\n}\nconsole.log(num1); // OK : num1 is declared in the current block\nconsole.log(num2); // Error! num2 is not visible here\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chapter02/#expressions","title":"Expressions","text":"<p>An expression is a piece of code that produces a value. An expression is created by combining variables, values and operators. Every expression has a value and thus a type. Calculating an expression's value is called evaluation.

However, an expression can integrate parenthesis that modify these priorities.</p> <pre><code>let e = 3 + 2 * 4; // e contains 11 (3 + 8)\ne = (3 + 2) * 4;   // e contains 20 (5 * 4)\n</code></pre> <p>It is possible to include expressions in a string by using backticks (`) to delimit the string. Such a string is called a template literal. Inside a template literal, expressions are identified by the <code>${expression}</code> syntax.</p> <p>This is often used to create strings containing the values of some variables.</p> <pre><code>const country = \"France\";\nconsole.log(`I live in ${country}`); // Show \"I live in France\"\nconst x = 3;\nconst y = 7;\nconsole.log(`${x} + ${y} = ${x + y}`); // Show \"3 + 7 = 10\"\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chapter02/#type-conversions","title":"Type conversions","text":"<p>An expression's evaluation can result in type conversions. These are called implicit conversions, as they happen automatically without the programmer's intervention.

This is called explicit conversion. JavaScript has the <code>Number()</code>  and <code>String()</code> commands that convert the value between the parenthesis to a number or a string.</p> <pre><code>const h = \"5\";\nconsole.log(h + 1); // Concatenation: show the string \"51\"\nconst i = Number(\"5\");\nconsole.log(i + 1); // Numerical addition: show the number 6\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"chapter02/#user-interactions","title":"User interactions","text":""},{"location":"chapter02/#entering-information","title":"Entering information","text":"<p>Once you start using variables, you can write programs that exchange information with the user.</p> <pre><code>const name = prompt(\"Enter your first name:\");\nalert(`Hello, ${name}`);\n</code></pre> <p>During execution, a dialog box pops up, asking for your name.</p> <p></p> <p>This is the result of the JavaScript command <code>prompt(\"Enter your first name:\")</code>.</p> <p>Type your name and click OK.

In particular, the Chrome JavaScript engine, codenamed V8, became open source in 2008 and was a huge step forward in general performance and optimization.</p> <p></p> <p>The core idea behind Node.js was simple yet visionary: since the V8 engine is so good at executing code, why not leverage its power to create efficient JavaScript applications outside the browser? And thus Node.js was born in 2009, originally written by Ryan Dahl. Its project quickly became very popular and Node is now one of the top technologies for building apps and creating APIs with JavaScript.</p> <p></p> <p>Node also made it easier for developers to publish, share and reuse code. Today, hundreds of thousands of ready-to-use JavaScript libraries, called packages, are available and easy to integrate in any Node-based project (more on that later).

Each part should focus on a specific task, making it far easier to understand and reuse. The general application's behavior results from the interactions between these building blocks.</p> <p>These smaller parts are sometimes referred to as components in other environments. In Node, they are called modules and can come under different forms. The general definition of a module is: anything that can be loaded using Node's <code>require()</code> function.

A better solution is to define the HTML content in an external file stored in a dedicated subfolder, and return that file as a result of the request.</p> <p>For example, create a subfolder named <code>views</code> and a file named <code>hello.html</code> inside it. Give the HTML file the following content.</p> <pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;meta charset=\"utf-8\"&gt;\n&lt;title&gt;Hello web page&lt;/title&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Hello web page&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;div id=\"content\"&gt;Hello!&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Then, update the callback for the <code>\"/hello\"</code> route to send the HTML file as the request response.</p> <pre><code>// Return a web page for requests to \"/hello\"\napp.get(\"/hello\", (request, response) =&gt; {\nresponse.sendFile(`${__dirname}/views/hello.html`);\n});\n</code></pre> <p>Pointing your browser to the <code>\"/hello\"</code> URL (http://localhost:3000/hello if your server runs locally) should now display the web page.</p> <p></p> <p>Most web pages will need to load client-side resources such as images, CSS and JavaScript files. A common practice is to put these assets in a dedicated subfolder.</p> <p>For example, create a <code>public</code> subfolder and a <code>hello.js</code> JavaScript file inside it with the following content.</p> <pre><code>// Update the \"content\" DOM element\ndocument.getElementById(\"content\").textContent = \"Hello from JavaScript!\";\n</code></pre> <p>You should now have the following folder structure for your server.</p> <p></p> <p>Update the <code>hello.html</code> to load this JavaScript file.</p> <pre><code>&lt;script src=\"/hello.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Lastly, you must tell Express that client assets are located in the <code>public</code> subfolder, so that the server can serve them directly. Add the following code towards the beginning of your main application file.</p> <pre><code>// Serve content of the \"public\" subfolder directly\napp.use(express.static(\"public\"));\n</code></pre> <p>Accessing the <code>\"/hello\"</code> URL shows you a slightly different result. The <code>hello.js</code> file was loaded and executed by the browser, updating the web page content.</p> <p></p> <p>In this example, JavaScript was used both for back-end (server side) and front-end (client side) programming.

Both share a similar syntax, but their use cases and design principles are very different.</p> <p>The idea behind JavaScript was to create a simple language to make web pages dynamic and interactive. Back then, pages were very simple.</p> <p></p> <p>Web builders started gradually enriching their pages by adding JavaScript code. For this code to work, the recipient web browser (the software used to surf the web) had to be able to process JavaScript. This language has been progressively integrated into browsers, and now all browsers are able to handle it!</p> <p>Because of the explosion of the Web and the advent of the web 2.0 (based on rich, interactive pages), JavaScript has become increasingly popular. Web browser designers have optimized the execution speed of JavaScript, which means it's now a very fast language.</p> <p>This led to the emergence of the Node.js platform, which allows you to create JavaScript applications outside the browser. Thanks to a software called MongoDB, JavaScript has even entered the database world (software whose role is to store information).</p> <p>Finally, the popularity of smartphones and tablets with different systems (iOS, Android, Windows Phone) has led to the emergence of so-called cross-platform development tools.
